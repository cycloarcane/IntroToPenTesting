**Week 1**

Welcome to your introduction to penetration testing at **TheMultiverseSchool** using Hack The Box (HTB)! This guide will walk you through signing up for HTB, accessing Pwnbox, and attacking your first "Starting Point" machine. Let's dive in!

## Step 1: Sign Up for Hack The Box

1. **Visit the HTB website**: Go to [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/).
2. **Register**: Click on the "Get Started" button, then "HTB Labs" and fill out the registration form with your details.
3. **Email Verification**: Check your email for a verification link and click on it to verify your account.

## Step 2: Accessing Pwnbox

Pwnbox is a browser-based virtual machine provided by HTB, equipped with all the tools you need for penetration testing. Here's how to use it:

1. **Log in to HTB**: Use your newly created credentials to log in.
2. **Navigate to Pwnbox**: Click on "Starting Point" on the left hand panel, then once you select a machine, we'll probably start with **Meow**, you will see a 'Connect with pwnbox' option.
3. **Spawn Pwnbox**:
   - Choose the closest server with the lowest latency.
   - Click "Start pwnbox".
   - Wait for the initialization to complete. You'll see options to open a desktop via VNC, terminate, or open an SSH terminal.

For more details, visit the [Pwnbox Help Center](https://help.hackthebox.com/en/articles/7913354-mastering-pwnbox).

## Step 3: Using Pwnbox

Once your Pwnbox is running:

1. **Open Desktop**: Click the "Open Desktop" button to access the graphical interface.
2. **Tools Available**: You will find pre-installed tools like Firefox, PyCharm, Postman, BurpSuite, Metasploit, and VSCodium.
3. **Saving Work**: Use the `~/my_data` folder to save any scripts or files you need for your sessions, this is persistent across instances, all other folders are not.

## Step 4: Starting Point Machine

Now that your environment is set up, let's attack your first machine!

1. **Navigate to Starting Point**: On the HTB dashboard, click on "Starting Point".
2. **Select a Machine**: Choose the first machine in the list and click on it to view details.
3. **Spawn Machine**: Click "Spawn Machine" to start it.
4. **Connect to Machine**: Use the provided IP address to begin probing the target machine.

### Example Attack

Here is a basic example of how you might start attacking a machine:

1. **Ping the Target**: Check if the machine is up and running.
   ```sh
   ping [IP_ADDRESS]
   ```
2. **Run an Nmap Scan**: Identify open ports and services.
   ```sh
   nmap -sC -sV [IP_ADDRESS]
   ```
3. **Investigate Services**: Based on the Nmap results, investigate the services running on the open ports.

## Conclusion

You're now set up and ready to start your penetration testing journey on Hack The Box! Remember to explore, be curious, and never hesitate to look up resources or ask for help.
