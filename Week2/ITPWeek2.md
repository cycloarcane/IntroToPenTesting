# Week 2

Welcome to week 2 of your introduction to penetration testing at TheMultiverseSchool! This week, we will continue with another "Starting Point" machine from Hack The Box (HTB), discuss virtual machines (VMs) and VPN connections, and provide guidance on setting up Kali Linux and connecting to HTB using OpenVPN.

## Step 1: Starting Point Machine

### Connecting to a New Machine

1. **Log in to HTB**: Use your credentials to log in.
2. **Navigate to Starting Point**: Click on "Starting Point" on the left-hand panel.
3. **Select a Machine**: This week, let's target the "Fawn" machine.
4. **Spawn Machine**: Click "Spawn Machine" to start it.
5. **Connect to Machine**: Use the provided IP address to begin probing the target machine.

### Example Attack on "Fawn"

1. **Ping the Target**: Ensure the machine is up and running.
    ```sh
    ping [IP_ADDRESS]
    ```
2. **Run an Nmap Scan**: Identify open ports and services.
    ```sh
    nmap -sC -sV [IP_ADDRESS]
    ```
3. **Investigate Services**: Based on the Nmap results, investigate the services running on the open ports.

## Step 2: Introduction to VMs and VPNs

### Virtual Machines (VMs)

A virtual machine (VM) allows you to run an operating system within your current operating system. This is useful for penetration testing as it isolates your testing environment.

1. **Choose a VM Software**:
    - VirtualBox: Free and open-source.
    - VMware: Offers more features but requires a license.
    - UTM (for M1/M2 Macs): Free and designed for ARM architecture.
    - Parallels Desktop (for M1/M2 Macs): Offers more features and optimized for ARM architecture.

    - Open UTM and click the "+" button to create a new virtual machine.
    - Select "Virtualize" for a full virtual machine.
    - Choose "Linux" as the operating system and proceed with the setup.
    - Name your VM and allocate resources (RAM, CPU).
    - In the "Drives" section, click "New Drive" and attach the Kali Linux ARM image you downloaded.

### VPN Connections

A VPN (Virtual Private Network) allows you to connect securely to another network over the internet. HTB requires a VPN connection to access the machines.

1. **Download OpenVPN**:
    - For Linux: Use your package manager, e.g., `sudo apt-get install openvpn`.

### Setting Up VPN for HTB

1. **Download the HTB VPN Configuration File**:
    - Go to your HTB profile, and download the connection pack from the "Access" page.
2. **Connect Using OpenVPN**:
    ```sh
    sudo openvpn --config [path_to_config_file]
    ```

## Step 3: Connecting to Hack The Box with OpenVPN

### For Linux

1. **Install OpenVPN**: Use your package manager.
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install openvpn
    ```
2. **Connect**: Use the command line to connect.
    ```sh
    sudo openvpn --config [path_to_config_file]
    ```
